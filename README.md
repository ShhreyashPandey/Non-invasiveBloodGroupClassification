# Non-invasiveBloodGroupClassification
The fingerprints of humans can be a very useful tool due to their uniqueness. This project will look into fingerprints with the aim of determining the blood group of humans. This project tries to find out if there is any interrelation between the patterns of fingerprints and blood groups. It has taken the approach of collecting fingerprints as images from Kaggle and testing 4 state-of-the-art supervised machine learning models to determine the blood group on the basis of ABO blood types. The research showcased Support Vector Machine as the best algorithm for correctly classifying blood groups, achieving an accuracy of 75%.
